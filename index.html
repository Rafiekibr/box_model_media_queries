    <h2>Paragraph 1</h2>
    <p>Snow White and the Huntsman is a 2012 American fantasy film based on 
        the German fairy tale "Snow White" compiled by the Brothers Grimm. The film 
        is the directorial debut of Rupert Sanders, with a screenplay by Evan Daugherty, 
        John Lee Hancock and Hossein Amini, from a screen story by Daugherty. The 
        cast includes Kristen Stewart, Charlize Theron, Chris Hemsworth, Sam Claflin, and 
        Bob Hoskins in his final film performance. In the film's retelling of the tale, 
        Snow White grows up imprisoned by her evil stepmother, Queen Ravenna, a powerful 
        sorceress. After Snow White escapes into the forest, Ravenna enlists Eric, 
        the Huntsman to capture her, but he becomes her compatriot in a 
        quest to overthrow Ravenna.

    <p>Snow White and the Huntsman was theatrically released in the United Kingdom on 
        May 30, 2012 and in the United States on June 1, 2012, by Universal Pictures. 
        It was a success at the box office, earning $396 million worldwide against a 
        $170 million budget. Although critics praised the production design and visual 
        effects, Theron and Hemsworth's performances, and the musical score and action 
        sequences, Stewart and Claflin's performances received mixed reviews, and the 
        screenplay was heavily criticized. The film received two Oscar nominations for 
        Best Visual Effects and Best Costume Design at the 85th Academy Awards.
